# Build from latest ubuntu version
FROM	ubuntu:latest

# Install build-essential (to create C++ projects), vim, curl and zsh
# run apt-get clean to clean the package cache and free up space
# rm -rf any lists that are no longer needed after Ã¥installing the packages

RUN		apt-get update && \

# Install Oh My Zsh, because I want to
RUN		sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
